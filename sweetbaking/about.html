        <h2>About Sweet Baking</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Sweet Baking! I have always loved baking, as a kid I would watch my mom bake for hours. 
        When I was about 8 I got my first Easy Bake Oven and never stopped from there. I eventually transitioned to a real oven and stove, and
        became a self-taught baker in my free time.</p>
        <p>
        Sweet Baking is meant to be a baking blog/collection of my favorite dessert recipes. 
        The purpose of this website is to share my recipes with other bakers in an easy-to-read format, and document my learning process as a self-taught baker. 
        Having recipes all in one place makes this website an easy place to access your favorite recipes without having to shuffle for lost recipe cards.
        I hope you find Sweet Baking insightful and helpful, as I continue to share my baking journey!</p>
